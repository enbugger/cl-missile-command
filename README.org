* Missile Command

[[./missile-command-game.png]]

This is a port of [[https://github.com/massung][Jeffrey Massung's]] example game [[https://github.com/massung/r-cade/blob/main/examples/defender.rkt][defender.rkt]] to Common Lisp.

This was a project for me to learn Common Lisp and Raylib.

* Building

Requires [[https://github.com/sbcl/sbcl][SBCL]] and [[https://www.quicklisp.org/][Quicklisp]].

#+begin_src shell
  # Build
  sh make.sh

  # Run
  ./missile-commnad
#+end_src

* Hacking

#+begin_src shell
  sbcl --load dev.lisp

  # then connect with sly on port 4005
#+end_src

* Installing on Windows

Do everything in your Developer(!) PowerShell.
For that you have to install Visual Studio with C++ Desktop Development

Make sure vcpkg is pointing to correct vcpkg installation in CMakeUserPresets.json

#+begin_src powershell
(Get-Item (Get-Command vcpkg).Path).DirectoryName
#+end_src

#+begin_src powershell
cmake --preset=default
cmake --build build
#+end_src
